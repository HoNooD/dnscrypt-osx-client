          <h1>OpenDNS user interface for DNSCrypt (preview release)</h1>

<p>DNS is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Internet.  It's
used any time you visit a website, send an email, have an IM
conversation or do anything else online.  While OpenDNS has provided
world-class security using DNS for years, the underlying DNS protocol
has not been secure enough for our comfort.</p>

<p>The "last mile" is the portion of your Internet connection between
your computer and your ISP.</p>

<p>DNSCrypt is a way of securing the "last mile" of DNS traffic and
resolving an entire class of serious security concerns with the DNS
protocol.</p>

<p>There have been numerous examples of tampering, or man-in-the-middle
attacks, and snooping of DNS traffic at the last mile and it
represents a serious security risk that we've always wanted to fix.</p>

<p>In the same way the SSL turns HTTP web traffic into HTTPS encrypted
Web traffic, DNSCrypt turns regular DNS traffic into authenticated and
encrypted DNS traffic that is secure from eavesdropping and
man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<p>It doesn't require any changes to domain names or how they work, it
simply provides a method for securely encrypting communication between
our customers and our DNS servers in our data centers.</p>
