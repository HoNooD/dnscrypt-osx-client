{"body":"OpenDNS user interface for DNSCrypt (preview release)\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\nDNS is one of the fundamental building blocks of the Internet.  It's\r\nused any time you visit a website, send an email, have an IM\r\nconversation or do anything else online.  While OpenDNS has provided\r\nworld-class security using DNS for years, the underlying DNS protocol\r\nhas not been secure enough for our comfort.\r\n\r\nThe \"last mile\" is the portion of your Internet connection between\r\nyour computer and your ISP.\r\n\r\nDNSCrypt is a way of securing the \"last mile\" of DNS traffic and\r\nresolving an entire class of serious security concerns with the DNS\r\nprotocol.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous examples of tampering, or man-in-the-middle\r\nattacks, and snooping of DNS traffic at the last mile and it\r\nrepresents a serious security risk that we've always wanted to fix.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the SSL turns HTTP web traffic into HTTPS encrypted\r\nWeb traffic, DNSCrypt turns regular DNS traffic into authenticated and\r\nencrypted DNS traffic that is secure from eavesdropping and\r\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't require any changes to domain names or how they work, it\r\nsimply provides a method for securely encrypting communication between\r\nour customers and our DNS servers in our data centers.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"OpenDNS DNSCrypt client (GUI for OpenDNS + dnscrypt-proxy) for OSX","name":"DNSCrypt OSX client for OpenDNS","note":"Don't delete this file!
